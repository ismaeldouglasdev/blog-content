## Introduction
When it comes to managing dependencies in JavaScript projects, npm is the industry giant. With over 1.5 million packages available, it is the largest open-source repository in the world. However, over time, npm has been facing chronic issues that affect the speed, security, and stability of projects. Here, I will outline the problems with npm and how two new players, Bun and Deno, are gaining traction in the market.

## The npm and its problems
The npm is a package manager that allows developers to install and manage dependencies in their projects. However, over time, npm has faced issues with speed, security, and stability. One of the main problems is the speed of package installation. As the number of available packages increases, installing dependencies can take a long time, which affects developer productivity.

Another problem is security. With npm, it is common for packages to be installed with root permissions, which can be a security risk. Additionally, npm does not have a strict security policy, which can allow malicious packages to be published.

## Yarn and pnpm as an answer
To address the issues with npm, two new package managers have emerged: Yarn and pnpm. Yarn is a package manager created by Facebook to resolve npm's speed and security issues. Yarn is faster than npm and has a more stringent security policy.

Pnpm, on the other hand, is a package manager created to address npm's stability and security issues. Pnpm is more stable than npm and has a more stringent security policy.

## Bun: JS runtime + package manager
Bun is a new player in the package manager market. Bun is a JavaScript runtime that also functions as a package manager. Bun is faster than npm and has a more rigorous security policy. Additionally, Bun is easier to use than npm and has a simpler syntax.

An example of how to use Bun is as follows:
```bash
bun install react
```
This will install the react package and its dependencies.

## Deno: security by default
Deno is another new player in the package manager market. Deno is a JavaScript runtime that was created to be more secure than npm. Deno has a security-by-default policy, which means that packages are installed with limited permissions.

An example of how to use Deno is as follows:
```bash
deno install react
```
This will install the react package and its dependencies with limited permissions.

## Will npm still last?
With the rise of Bun and Deno, it's natural to wonder if npm will still last. The answer is yes. npm is still the largest open-source repository in the world and has a very large community of developers. However, it's important to note that npm needs to improve its speed, security, and stability to continue being relevant.

## Conclusion
In summary, npm is a package manager that has chronic issues with speed, security, and stability. Bun and Deno are two new players in the market that are gaining traction with their stricter security policies and simpler syntax. However, npm is still the largest open-source repository in the world and has a very large community of developers.

Practical takeaways:

* Npm has chronic issues with speed, security, and stability.
* Bun and Deno are two new players in the market that are gaining traction with their stricter security policies and simpler syntax.
* Npm is still the largest open-source repository in the world and has a very large community of developers.
* It is essential to choose the right package manager for your project, depending on your needs for speed, security, and stability.
