There comes a point in every growing project where a table's id stops being an
integer. You start with `SERIAL`, the `id` is 1, 2, 3, and everything works. Then
you need to merge two environments, import data, accept events from a machine
that never touched your database, and `1` stops being true.

That's when most people reach for the UUID. And they reach for it thinking the
UUID solves a uniqueness problem. It does — but that's the least interesting
part of it.

## What a UUID actually is

UUID stands for Universally Unique Identifier: a 128-bit identifier standardized
in RFC 4122, written as eight-four-four-four-twelve hexadecimal characters:

```
9f8e7d6c-5b4a-4392-8180-7f6e5d4c3b2a
```

The "universally" is what trips people up. It isn't a magic property of the
number — it's a property of the **process that generated it**. Nobody
coordinates these IDs. Every machine, every service, every browser generates its
own, and the chance of a collision between two of them is negligible.

That detail has a consequence worth keeping in mind: UUID works best *precisely
when there is no central place*. That's why it dominates message queues,
distributed systems, and anywhere two producers have to agree on an id without
talking to a database.

## The anatomy of a UUID v4

A UUID isn't 128 bits of randomness. It has structure, and that structure is what
distinguishes the versions.

In a v4 UUID like `9f8e7d6c-5b4a-4392-8180-7f6e5d4c3b2a`:

- The first block `9f8e7d6c` is 32 random bits
- The second block `5b4a` is 16 more random bits
- The third block `4392` starts with the nibble `4` — the **version identifier**
- The fourth block `8180` starts with `8`, `9`, `a`, or `b` — the **variant** (the
  bit layout reserved by the RFC)
- The fifth block is random

That is 122 bits of usable entropy, not 128. This is the math behind the famous
line about how many IDs you'd have to generate for a 50% chance of a collision.

## The cost nobody mentions

A bare v4 UUID, with nothing layered on top, is a **36-character** string. Two
consequences:

**Index size.** A `UUID` primary key stored as `TEXT` or `VARCHAR(36)` is not just
bigger than a `BIGINT`, it's badly aligned for most things. In Postgres, a pure
16-byte `UUID` is the practical choice; `VARCHAR(36)` is waste. The common advice
is to store it as `UUID`/`BYTEA` and expose it as a string.

**Ordering.** v4 is random. As a primary key, that turns into page splits: every
insert anywhere in the index can push pages around. On a high-write table the
cost is real, and it shows up in `pg_stat_user_indexes` or in inserts that take
milliseconds.

There are escapes for both, and they're worth knowing before you choose. **UUID
v7** is the direct answer: 48 timestamp bits at the top, randomness below. It
stays a UUID — same format, same compatibility — but it sorts by time, which
fixes the page split and makes the index behave like a growing integer. For most
new systems, that's the call I'd make without thinking hard about it.

## When not to use UUID

- **A user-facing key that also has to sort.** If insertion order matters to the
  client, a growing integer is simpler and gives you nothing for free.
- **A table you query by prefix.** `WHERE id LIKE '9f8e%'` doesn't use an index on
  v4; on v7 the prefix is a timestamp, and it does.
- **A table that will never be merged or imported.** If it exists in one database
  and nothing else consumes the id, `SERIAL`/`BIGSERIAL` is simpler.

And there's the opposite mistake: **you don't need the whole identifier**. Plenty
of teams use a UUID and keep a sequential `id` alongside it, duplicating the work
for no reason.

## When to use it

- Two or more sources write to the same table
- Rows travel between environments and need to join without renaming
- The id is created client-side and the database shouldn't be consulted for it
- Someday you'll open the project and someone will generate ids elsewhere

In those cases, UUID is the answer with the least risk for whoever doesn't know
the future yet.

## Generating them correctly in JavaScript

One detail that shows up in code review: **don't use `Math.random()`**.

```js
// Works until someone needs it. Math.random is not a CSPRNG.
function badId() {
  return 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'.replace(/[xy]/g, (c) => {
    const r = (Math.random() * 16) | 0;
    const v = c === 'x' ? r : (r & 0x3) | 0x8;
    return v.toString(16);
  });
}
```

`Math.random()` isn't a cryptographic generator, and the npm `uuid` package used
it as a fallback **before version 7** — v7 removed that path, and npm deprecated
the older versions over it. With platform APIs available, the package became a
dependency you don't need: `crypto.randomUUID()` is in the browser and in Node.js
and does the whole job.

```js
// One path. The rest of the app doesn't care where the id came from.
export function generateBatch(count) {
  return Array.from({ length: count }, () => crypto.randomUUID());
}
```

If the environment lacks `crypto.randomUUID()` — rare, but it happens on older
Node and in non-secure contexts — the fallback is `crypto.getRandomValues()` with
the version and variant bits set by hand:

```js
function uuidV4Fallback() {
  const bytes = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(16));
  bytes[6] = (bytes[6] & 0x0f) | 0x40; // version 4
  bytes[8] = (bytes[8] & 0x3f) | 0x80; // variant 10xx
  const hex = Array.from(bytes, (b) => b.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')).join('');
  return `${hex.slice(0, 8)}-${hex.slice(8, 12)}-${hex.slice(12, 16)}-${hex.slice(16, 20)}-${hex.slice(20)}`;
}
```

That's enough to generate one or a few. When you need dozens, you can roll it
yourself — but at that point the question worth asking is whether you're minting
thousands of ids client-side per request, which is a sign the architecture wants
a conversation.

If you need to generate a batch right now, the [UUID v4
generator](/ferramentas/uuid) does it without making you think about any of this.

## The short version

UUID is the industry default because it solves the right problem: it removes the
need for coordination. The price is the index, and the price drops if you pick
**v7** over **v4**. Outside the distributed case, it's complexity you bought
without needing it.
