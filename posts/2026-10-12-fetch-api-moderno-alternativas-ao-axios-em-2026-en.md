## Modern Fetch API: alternatives to axios in 2026

You install Axios out of habit and can't even remember why — while native `fetch`, already in the browser, handles most cases with fewer dependencies. With `AbortController`, `Promise.all`, and a tiny wrapper, you can forget Axios without losing anything. Here you'll compare both approaches in real 2026 code.

### Native Fetch: what has changed

The Fetch API, introduced in modern JavaScript, brought a new way to handle HTTP requests natively, eliminating the need for external libraries like Axios in many cases. One of the main changes is the way data is handled. The Fetch API returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `Response` object, allowing for more efficient control over the result of the request.

A basic example of using the Fetch API is as follows:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('There was a problem with the fetch operation:', error));
```

With the Fetch API, error handling becomes more explicit, allowing the developer to deal with different states of the request more clearly.

### Interceptors

One of the features that Axios offers, which is not always immediately evident in the Fetch API, is interceptors. Interceptors allow you to manipulate requests or responses before they are processed by your application's logic. This can include adding headers, handling errors, among others.

To implement behavior similar to interceptors in the Fetch API, you can create a function that encapsulates the fetch call:

```javascript
const fetchWithInterceptors = async (url, options = {}) => {
  // Add headers or manipulate options here
  options.headers = {
    ...options.headers,
    'Authorization': 'Bearer token'
  };

  const response = await fetch(url, options);
  
  // Handle the response
  if (!response.ok) {
    const errorData = await response.json();
    throw new Error(errorData.message);
  }
```

  return response.json();
};

// Using the function with interceptors
fetchWithInterceptors('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));

### Retry with exponential backoff

API call failures can occur for various reasons, and implementing a retry strategy is crucial for ensuring a good user experience. The exponential backoff pattern is an efficient approach where the time between attempts increases exponentially.

An implementation example can be seen below:

```javascript
const fetchWithRetry = async (url, options = {}, retries = 3, backoff = 300) => {
  try {
    return await fetch(url, options);
  } catch (error) {
    if (retries > 0) {
      await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, backoff));
      return fetchWithRetry(url, options, retries - 1, backoff * 2);
    }
    throw error;
  }
};

// Using the function with retry
fetchWithRetry('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Failed after retries:', error));
```

### Abort and timeout

One of the major limitations of the original Fetch API was the lack of a built-in method to abort requests. However, the introduction of `AbortController` in JavaScript provided an elegant solution to this problem.

Below is an example of how to implement abort and timeout:

```javascript
const fetchWithTimeout = (url, options = {}, timeout = 5000) => {
  const controller = new AbortController();
  const signal = controller.signal;

  const fetchPromise = fetch(url, { ...options, signal });

  const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      controller.abort();
      reject(new Error('Request timed out'));
    }, timeout);
  });

  return Promise.race([fetchPromise, timeoutPromise]);
};

// Using the function with timeout
fetchWithTimeout('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Fetch error:', error));
```

### SWR and React Query

When it comes to managing data states in React applications, libraries like SWR and React Query stand out. Both offer solutions for caching, revalidation, and data synchronization, facilitating the efficient and optimized implementation of API calls.

SWR, developed by the Vercel team, is a library based on the stale-while-revalidate strategy. This means that when you make a request, the cached data is returned immediately, while a new request is made in the background to update the data.

Here is a simple example of using SWR:

```javascript
import useSWR from 'swr';

const fetcher = url => fetch(url).then(res => res.json());

function App() {
  const { data, error } = useSWR('https://api.example.com/data', fetcher);

  if (error) return <div>Error loading data</div>;
  if (!data) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return <div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;
}
```

### Comparison

The choice between Fetch API, Axios, and libraries like SWR or React Query will depend on the specific needs of your project. The Fetch API is a lightweight and efficient solution for basic requests, while Axios offers additional features such as interceptors and request cancellation.

SWR and React Query, on the other hand, are more suitable for applications that require more robust state management and data synchronization.

- **Fetch API**: Native, lightweight, and modern. Ideal for simple requests.
- **Axios**: Robust library with support for interceptors and cancellation.
- **SWR/React Query**: Focused on data and state management, caching, and revalidation.

### Conclusion

The landscape of HTTP requests in JavaScript has evolved significantly, and today we have a variety of tools and approaches at our disposal. The Fetch API has established itself as a viable alternative to Axios, especially for developers looking to minimize external dependencies. At the same time, libraries like SWR and React Query expand the options, offering more advanced solutions for data management.

**Practical Takeaways:**
- The Fetch API is a lightweight and efficient option for HTTP requests.
- Interceptors can be simulated with functions that wrap the Fetch.
- Implementing retry with exponential backoff can improve the robustness of requests.
- The AbortController allows aborting requests, resolving a limitation of the Fetch API.
- SWR and React Query are excellent for advanced state and data management in React applications.
